### A Python Online Disc Server

Share your optical drive or iso images over a network to a Mac OS client.

Have you ever wondered what the "Remote Disc" in Finder is for? Well, it's so you can use a CD/DVD drive attached to
another computer. It's a kind of network block device that apple integrated into Finder some years ago but was never
fully realised.

Now that I find myself in a situation where I don't have an optical drive anywhere, but still need to use optical discs
from time to time I thought it would be useful to write support for apples remote disc functionality serving from a
linux system.
